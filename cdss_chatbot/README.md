# RAG-Enhanced Clinical Decision Support System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model in Django with a simple HTML frontend. The system provides clinical decision support by analyzing medical queries, retrieving relevant medical knowledge, and generating responses using a combination of retrieval and generation techniques.

## Features

- RAG-enhanced chatbot for clinical decision support
- Modern, responsive UI
- Detailed analysis of medical queries
- Retrieval of relevant medical knowledge
- Generation of differential diagnoses

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.2+
- Google Gemini API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cdss_chatbot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Update the Gemini API key in `settings.py`:

```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

## Running the Application

1. Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/rag-chatbot/
```

## Usage

1. Type your medical query in the input field
2. Press Enter or click the Send button
3. View the chatbot's response and the detailed analysis

## Project Structure

- `chatbot_app/`: Django app containing the RAG system and views
  - `rag_system.py`: Implementation of the RAG model
  - `views.py`: Django views for handling requests
  - `urls.py`: URL routing for the application
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for the frontend
- `sample_medical_knowledge.json`: Sample medical knowledge for the RAG system
- `settings.py`: Django settings including RAG configuration

## How It Works

1. The user submits a medical query through the frontend
2. The query is sent to the Django backend
3. The RAG system processes the query:
   - Retrieves relevant medical knowledge from the vector database
   - Analyzes the query and retrieved knowledge
   - Generates a response using the Gemini model
4. The response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user

## Customization

You can customize the RAG system by:

1. Adding more medical knowledge to `sample_medical_knowledge.json`
2. Modifying the RAG system parameters in `rag_system.py`
3. Updating the frontend design in `templates/chatbot_app/rag_chatbot.html`
